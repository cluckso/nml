# What Happens After Sign-Up (Service Business Owner)

## 1. Sign up

- Create an account (email/password). After sign-in you’re sent to **Pricing** (plan-first flow).

---

## 2. Choose a plan first

- On **Pricing**, pick Starter / Pro / Local Plus and click **“Choose plan & continue”**.
- You go to Stripe checkout. After payment, you’re redirected to **Onboarding**.

---

## 3. Onboarding (plan-aware)

- Set up your business: industry, name, address, business hours.
- **Phone setup (one place):** Enter your **business line** (for forwarding to the AI). Call summaries are sent by email.
- Fields like departments, CRM, after-hours emergency only show when they’re included in your plan (Pro / Local Plus).

---

## 4. Dashboard — connect your call assistant

- On the dashboard you’ll see **“Connect your call assistant”**.
- Click **“Connect to my call assistant”**. The app creates your AI (Retell) and, when available, assigns a phone number.
- After connecting, the same card shows **phone setup in one place:**
  - **1. Business line → forward to this AI number** (with step-by-step instructions).
  - **2. Your number for call alerts** (the one you set in onboarding).

Forward your business line to the AI number (via your carrier or Retell). Then the AI is answering your calls and you get alerts at the number you set.

---

## 5. After that

- **Incoming calls** to the AI number are answered by your AI (business name, hours, intake).
- **You get** call summaries by email. **Calls** in the app show transcripts, lead tags, etc.
- **Billing** tracks minutes and overage. **Weekly reports** (Local Plus) by email.

**Flow:** Sign up → choose plan (Pricing / checkout) → onboarding (plan-based fields, one phone setup) → dashboard → **Connect to my call assistant** → forward your line to the number shown. Both numbers (AI + alerts) are managed in one place.
