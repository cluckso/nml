1️⃣ First: Your Real Cost per Customer (Baseline)

Let’s translate Retell into monthly costs.

Typical call volume for local service businesses

Most small businesses land here:

300–1,000 minutes/month

Busy trades (HVAC, plumbers): 1,500–3,000 min/month in season

Retell raw cost
Minutes	Retell Cost
300 min	~$13.50
500 min	~$22.50
1,000 min	~$45.00
2,000 min	~$90.00
3,000 min	~$135.00

👉 Even at 1,000 minutes, your hard cost is under $50/month.

That gives you a LOT of pricing flexibility.

2️⃣ Pricing Philosophy (This Matters)

You are not selling minutes.

You are selling:

Missed-call recovery

After-hours intake

Less phone stress

Faster response = more booked jobs

“Feels like a receptionist”

So price it like:

A fraction of a human receptionist

A revenue protection tool, not a call tool

A human receptionist = $2,000–$3,500/month
Your AI = $99–$399/month

That’s the mental anchor.

4️⃣ Overage Pricing (IMPORTANT)

Do NOT cut people off.

Instead:

Overage: $0.10/min

Why?

Retell costs you ~$0.045

You still make margin

It discourages abuse without friction

Example:

Customer uses 3,000 min on Pro plan (1,200 included)

Extra 1,800 × $0.10 = $180

You pay ~$81 → still profitable

5️⃣ Setup Fees (Don’t Skip This)

Setup fees filter bad clients and pay you for time.

Recommended:

Starter: $0–$99

Pro: $199

Local Plus: $299–$499

Setup includes:

Custom intake script

Business logic

Testing

Call flow tuning

Phone number setup

💡 You can waive setup for early adopters or annual prepay.

6️⃣ Annual Discount (Cash Flow Hack)

Offer:

2 months free if paid annually

Example:

Pro = $199/mo → $1,990/year
This locks clients in and funds growth.

7️⃣ How to Explain the Price (Sales Script)

When they ask “Why does this cost $199?”:

“If you miss just one service call a month, this pays for itself.
Most of our clients capture 3–10 calls they were missing before.”

That’s it. Don’t talk tech.

8️⃣ Reality Check: Your Break-Even

At $199/mo:

You break even at ~4–5 customers

At 20 customers → real recurring income

At 50 customers → legit business

At 100 customers → hire help or automate onboarding
