## Ad image generation prompt

Use this (or a shortened version) in an image generator (DALL·E, Midjourney, Ideogram, etc.) to create a clean, professional ad image. Omit or shorten if the tool has token limits.

**Full prompt:**
> Professional advertisement concept for a B2B SaaS product: a modern local service business (e.g. HVAC or plumbing truck, or a small office with a phone and laptop). The scene suggests “always on” and “never miss a call”: soft glow on a phone or headset, clean desk or dashboard with a subtle “incoming call” or “new lead” vibe. Style: bright, trustworthy, slightly tech-forward but not cold — warm neutrals, one accent color (e.g. blue or green). No text or logos in the image. High quality, suitable for Facebook/Instagram/LinkedIn ad creative, 16:9 or 1:1 aspect ratio.

**Short prompt (for strict token limits):**
> Professional ad image: local service business desk with phone and laptop, soft glow suggesting 24/7 availability, warm neutrals and one blue accent, no text, high quality B2B ad style, 16:9.

**Alternate (more “customer calling in”):**
> Advertisement concept: person on phone in a repair truck or workshop, relaxed and confident, with a subtle “call answered” or “lead captured” mood. Clean, professional, warm lighting. No text or logos. Suitable for social ad, 1:1.

## Placement notes
- **Meta (Facebook/Instagram):** Use headline + short body + CTA; image 1:1 or 4:5.
- **Google Search:** Headlines ≤ 30 chars where possible; descriptions ≤ 90 chars.
- **LinkedIn:** More B2B tone; stress “local service businesses” and “lead capture.”
- **Image:** Keep key message in copy; use image for mood and category (service biz, phone, reliability).
