## Starter — $99/month  
*Perfect for solo operators & small shops*

**Setup:** $99

| Feature | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Up to 500 call minutes** | Your AI handles up to 500 minutes of talk time per month. Overage is billed at $0.10/min. |
| **AI answers calls during business hours or after-hours** | One AI answers 24/7. You choose when it’s “business hours” vs “after-hours” so routing or messaging can differ (e.g. “We’re closed; leave a message” vs “We’re open; I’ll help you now”). |
| **Captures caller name, number, and reason** | The AI asks for and stores name, phone number, and why they’re calling so you get structured lead info. |
| **Sends call summaries via text or email** | After each call you get a short summary (who called, what they wanted) by SMS and/or email. |
| **Missed-call recovery** | If someone hangs up or the call drops, the system can still capture their info or follow up so you don’t lose the lead. |
| **Custom greeting with your business name** | The AI uses your business name in the opening so callers hear something like “Thanks for calling [Your Business]. How can I help?” |

## Pro — $199/month  
*Best for growing service businesses*

**Setup:** $199

| Feature | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Up to 1,200 call minutes** | Same idea as Starter but with a higher monthly minute cap (1,200). |
| **Everything in Starter, plus:** | All Starter features are included. |
| **Custom intake flows by service type** | You define different question flows by service (e.g. plumbing vs HVAC). The AI follows the right script for each type. |
| **Appointment request capture** | The AI collects day/time preferences and details so you get “they want Tuesday afternoon” instead of just “they want an appointment.” |
| **Emergency vs non-emergency routing** | The AI decides if the call is urgent (e.g. no heat, leak) vs routine, and can route or notify you differently (e.g. faster callback for emergencies). |
| **SMS confirmation to callers** | After the call, the system can send a text to the caller (e.g. “We got your info; we’ll call back by 5pm”). |
| **Call transcripts + summaries** | You get both the full transcript and a short summary for each call. |
| **Email / CRM forwarding** | Call/lead data can be sent to your email or CRM (e.g. new contact + notes) so it lands in your existing workflow. |

## Local Plus — $299/month  
*Built for high-volume trades*

**Setup:** $299

| Feature | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Up to 2,500 call minutes** | Highest included minute allowance of the three plans. |
| **Priority call routing** | Your calls are treated with higher priority in the system (e.g. less wait, more reliable connection during busy times). |
| **Multi-department logic** | The AI can route by department (e.g. sales vs service, or by trade). Callers choose or are asked which department they need. |
| **After-hours emergency handling** | Dedicated logic for after-hours: e.g. detect emergencies, notify on-call person, or trigger specific after-hours protocols. |
| **Lead tagging (emergency, estimate, follow-up)** | Each lead is tagged (e.g. emergency, estimate request, follow-up) so you can sort and prioritize in your queue or CRM. |
| **Weekly usage & lead reports** | You get a weekly report (minutes used, number of leads, maybe by tag or department) so you can track volume and trends. |
| **Fully branded AI voice** | The AI voice can be customized to sound more like your brand (e.g. tone, accent, or a dedicated voice) so it feels like “your” receptionist. |
